### Neural Network Architecture for Image Super-Resolution

Our neural network aims to generate high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts through a tile-based approach. Here's a detailed description of the network's structure and workflow:

#### Input and Tile-Based Processing

- **Input**: The input to the network is a low-resolution image.
- **Tile-based Approach**: The low-resolution image is divided into smaller tiles of size \( \text{tile size} \times \text{tile size} \).
  - This method helps in managing computational load and improving efficiency.

#### Encoding

- **Tile Encoding**: Each tile is encoded into a specified latent dimension.
  - **Latent Dimension**: We typically use a latent dimension of 256 for encoding.
- **Encoding Network**: The encoder network processes each tile to produce a latent vector that captures the essential features of the tile.

#### Modulation

- **Modulator Network**: The latent vector produced by the encoder is then fed into the modulator network.
  - **Function**: The modulator adjusts the weights of the subsequent synthesizer network.
  - This modulation ensures that the weights of the synthesizer are tailored specifically for each tile, based on its encoded features.

#### Synthesis

- **Synthesizer Network**: The synthesizer network receives two types of inputs:
  - **Coordinates**: Coordinates relative to the tile (normalized to be between -1 and 1 for both dimensions).
  - **Modulated Parameters**: Parameters modulated by the modulator network.
- **Activation Function**: The synthesizer uses the sine function as its activation function.
  - **Parameters of Sine Function**: The frequency and other parameters of the sine function are modulated by the output of the modulator network.     

The synthesizer network generates the high-resolution data for each tile based on the input coordinates and the modulated parameters.

#### Training and Reconstruction

- **Training**: During the training phase, the network is optimized to reconstruct the high-resolution tiles from the low-resolution input tiles.      
  - High-resolution images are not directly reconstructed during training; instead, the focus is on individual tiles.

- **Reconstruction**: For visualization and verification, a reconstruction function is used to combine the individual high-resolution tiles back into a complete high-resolution image.

#### Summary of Steps

1. **Low-Resolution Image** is divided into tiles of size \( \text{tile size} \times \text{tile size} \).
2. Each **tile** is encoded into a latent vector.
3. The **encoded vector** is fed into the **modulator network**.
4. The **modulator network** tunes the weights of the **synthesizer network**.
5. The **synthesizer network** receives **coordinates** and **modulated parameters** to generate the high-resolution output for each tile.
6. **Training** focuses on perfecting this process tile-by-tile.
7. **Reconstruction function** assembles the tiles to visualize the complete high-resolution image.
